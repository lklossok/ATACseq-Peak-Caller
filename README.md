# ATACseq-Peak-Caller
ATAC-seq processing pipeline implemented using Snakemake. The workflow downloads paired-end FASTQ files from the European Nucleotide Archive, performs read quality control and trimming, aligns reads to a user-specified reference genome, removes PCR duplicates, and generates genome-wide chromatin accessibility peaks.
